# Summary of Fixes for GuestPix App

## 1. Dynamic Route Parameter Issues

### Files Fixed:

- `src/app/events/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/events/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- `src/app/guest/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/api/events/[id]/minimal/route.ts`

### Issue:
In Next.js 15, there was an incorrect pattern of awaiting dynamic route parameters with code like `const id = await params.id`. This is no longer necessary as params are directly accessible as a plain object.

### Fix:
- Removed all instances of `await` before `params.id`
- Updated the code to access params directly with `const id = params.id`

## 2. Image Rendering Improvements

### New Components:

- `src/app/components/OptimizedImage.tsx` - A client component that wraps Next.js Image component with error handling
- `src/app/events/[id]/EventBanner.tsx` - A client component for rendering event banners
- `src/app/guest/[id]/GuestBanner.tsx` - A client component for rendering guest page banners

### Improvements:
- Created a reusable `OptimizedImage` component that handles loading errors
- Implemented client-side image components to properly handle dynamic image loading and errors
- Replaced all instances of `<img>` tags with optimized components
- Improved error handling for image loading failures

## 3. Cloudinary Integration Improvements

### Files Updated:
- `src/app/events/create/page.tsx`
- `src/app/events/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- `next.config.js`

### New Files:
- `src/app/debug/cloudinary/page.tsx` - A debug page for testing Cloudinary image rendering
- `CLOUDINARY-GUIDE.md` - A comprehensive guide for setting up and testing Cloudinary

### Improvements:
- Added better error handling for Cloudinary uploads
- Added detailed logging for troubleshooting upload issues
- Configured proper CORS settings and image optimization
- Enhanced Next.js config to better support image optimization
- Created a debug tool for testing Cloudinary URLs

## 4. General Optimization

### General Improvements:
- Updated the project to use client components for interactive elements
- Separated server and client concerns for better performance
- Enhanced error handling throughout the application
- Improved UI responsiveness and error messaging

## Testing Instructions

1. Restart the server to apply all changes:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test the event page at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/events/[event-id]
   ```

3. Test the guest upload page at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/guest/[event-id]
   ```

4. Test Cloudinary image uploading and rendering using the debug page:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/debug/cloudinary
   ```

## Further Recommendations

1. Continue to monitor console logs for any warnings or errors
2. Consider adding more comprehensive error boundaries in client components
3. Review and update any remaining instances of direct image tags
4. Regularly test the application with different image types and sizes
5. Ensure Cloudinary configuration is properly set up as per the guide
